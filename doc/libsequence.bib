  title    = "Statistical tests for detecting positive selection by utilizing
              high-frequency variants",
  author   = "Zeng, Kai and Fu, Yun-Xin and Shi, Suhua and Wu, Chung-I",
  abstract = "By comparing the low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency parts of
              the frequency spectrum, we gain information on the evolutionary
              forces that influence the pattern of polymorphism in population
              samples. We emphasize the high-frequency variants on which
              positive selection and negative (background) selection exhibit
              different effects. We propose a new estimator of theta (the
              product of effective population size and neutral mutation rate),
              thetaL, which is sensitive to the changes in high-frequency
              variants. The new thetaL allows us to revise Fay and Wu's H-test
              by normalization. To complement the existing statistics (the
              H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test, E, which
              relies on the difference between thetaL and Watterson's thetaW.
              We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the recovery
              phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes the
              postselective sweep phase. The sensitivities of these tests to
              (or robustness against) background selection and demographic
              changes are also considered. Overall, D and H in combination can
              be most effective in detecting positive selection while being
              insensitive to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test,
              referred to as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is
              indeed sensitive primarily to directional selection and no other
              driving forces.",

  title    = "Hitchhiking under positive Darwinian selection",
  author   = "Fay, J C and Wu, C I",
  abstract = "Positive selection can be inferred from its effect on linked
              neutral variation. In the restrictive case when there is no
              recombination, all linked variation is removed. If recombination
              is present but rare, both deterministic and stochastic models of
              positive selection show that linked variation hitchhikes to
              either low or high frequencies. While the frequency distribution
              of variation can be influenced by a number of evolutionary
              processes, an excess of derived variants at high frequency is a
              unique pattern produced by hitchhiking (derived refers to the
              nonancestral state as determined from an outgroup). We adopt a
              statistic, H, to measure an excess of high compared to
              intermediate frequency variants. Only a few high-frequency
              variants are needed to detect hitchhiking since not many are
              expected under neutrality. This is of particular utility in
              regions of low recombination where there is not much variation
              and in regions of normal or high recombination, where the
              hitchhiking effect can be limited to a small (<1 kb) region.
              Application of the H test to published surveys of Drosophila
              variation reveals an excess of high frequency variants that are
              likely to have been influenced by positive selection.",

@ARTICLE{Tajima1989-de,
  title    = "Statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis by
              {DNA} polymorphism",
  author   = "Tajima, F",
  abstract = "The relationship between the two estimates of genetic variation
              at the DNA level, namely the number of segregating sites and the
              average number of nucleotide differences estimated from pairwise
              comparison, is investigated. It is found that the correlation
              between these two estimates is large when the sample size is
              small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using
              the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the
              neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only
              the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within
              population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer
              simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of
              a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this
              statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in
              Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large
              insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is
              suggested that the natural selection against large
              insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is
              maintained in a population.",

@ARTICLE{Hudson1985-cq,
  title    = "Statistical properties of the number of recombination events in
              the history of a sample of {DNA} sequences",
  author   = "Hudson, R R and Kaplan, N L",
  abstract = "Some statistical properties of samples of DNA sequences are
              studied under an infinite-site neutral model with recombination.
              The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination
              events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the
              number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously
              inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the
              mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined
              from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and
              variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations.
              It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the
              number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in
              a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The
              statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the
              recombination rate and the population size or, if the
              recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To
              illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila
              melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size
              of this species.",

  abstract = "With the aim of analyzing and interpreting data on DNA
              polymorphism obtained by DNA sequencing or restriction enzyme
              technique, a mathematical theory on the expected evolutionary
              relationship among DNA sequences (nucleons) sampled is developed
              under the assumption that the evolutionary change of nucleons is
              determined solely by mutation and random genetic drift. The
              statistical property of the number of nucleotide differences
              between randomly chosen nucleons and that of heterozygosity or
              nucleon diversity is investigated using this theory. These
              studies indicate that the estimates of the average number of
              nucleotide differences and nucleon diversity have a large
              variance, and a large part of this variance is due to stochastic
              factors. Therefore, increasing sample size does not help reduce
              the variance significantly The distribution of sample allele
              (nucleomorph) frequencies is also studied, and it is shown that a
              small number of samples are sufficient in order to know the
              distribution pattern.",
